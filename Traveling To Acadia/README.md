# Traveling to Acadia

Imagine you work at a travel agency and want to inform your customers of the best time to visit one of your favorite vacation locations, Acadia, Maine.
In this project, you will use flower bloom data, and flight information to recommend the best time of year for someone to make a trip to Maine.

Your goal is to create two histograms, each displaying the frequency of an occurrence each day of the year (either flights or flower blooms).

You will use the "in_bloom" variable to find a count of the number of flowers that start blooming each day of the year.

You will use the "flights" variable to find a count of the number of flights that occur each day of the year.
